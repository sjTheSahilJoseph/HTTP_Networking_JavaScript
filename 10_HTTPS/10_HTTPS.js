    HTTPS
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or HTTPS is an extension of the HTTP protocol.
    HTTPS secures the data transfer between client and server by encrypting all of the communication.

    HTTPS allows a client to safely share sensitive information with the server through an HTTP request, such as credit card information, passwords, or bank account numbers.

/*
    Basically, there are kind of 2 keys, the server generates.
        1. Public Key
        2. Private Key
    Public key -> Encryption
    Private Key -> Decryption

    But then the 3rd key is generated which can do both encryption/decryption.

    This way, the data is being sefe.

/*
    Security and Encryption
    HTTPS requires that the client use SSL or TLS to protect requests and traffic by encrypting the information in the request.
    HTTPS is just HTTP with extra security.

    HTTPS keeps your messages private, but not your identity
    While HTTPS encrypts what you are saying. It doesn't necassarily protect who you are.
    Tools like VPNs are needed for remaining anonymous online.

    HTTPS ensures that you're talking to the right person (or server)
    In addition to encrypting the information within a request, HTTPS uses digital signatures to prove that you're communicating with the server that you think you are.
    If a hacker were to intercept an HTTPS request by tapping into a network cable, they wouldn't be able to successfully pretend they are you bank's web server.
