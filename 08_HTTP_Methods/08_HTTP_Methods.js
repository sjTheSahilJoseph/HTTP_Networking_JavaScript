// HTTP Methods - GET.
// HTTP defines a set of methods that we use every time we make a request.

// The GET method.
// The GET method us used to 'get' a representation of a specified resource.
// You are not taking the data away from the server, but rather getting a representation,
// or copy, of the resource in its current state.
// A get request is considered a safe method to call multiple times because it doesn't alter the state of the server.

// Making a GET request using the Fetch API.
// The fetch() method accepts an optional init object parameter as its second argument that we can use to define things like:
// method: The HTTP method of the request, like GET.
// headers: The header to send.
// mode: Used for security.
